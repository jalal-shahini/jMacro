## A Custom Built Macro Keyboard

This is a macro keyboard I designed to be:

1. a Numpad once a month when I need one.
2. an easy way to type the special characters I use constantly when taking notes such as ※, ℍ, Ω, ℚ, ∵, ∴, ℘ etc.
3. a life-saver when playing games.

The keyboard uses an Atmega32u4 microcontroller.
It features 22 keys with two rotary encoders with a Schmitt-trigger for a clean signal.


### To Do for a Future Version

* Single LED indicator is too bright and not ideal. I will use backlight LEDs for each individual key.
* Rotary encoders and USB circuit will benefit from a 4 layer PCB.
* Switches are better to be hot swappable.
* The electolytic capacitors are THT to save costs, however, in the next versions it is better to use all SMD components.
